## Abstract
Cancer is an evolutionary disorder driven by stepwise accumulation of selectively advantageous mutations. These successive series of fitness-increasing mutations are considered as pathways of cancer progression, whose characterization is essential for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancer. Conjunctive Bayesian Networks (CBN) are probabilistic graphical models that have enabled inference of such mutational pathways from genomic data. Previously, we showed that CBN model can estimate the predictability of cancer evolution by reflecting the underlying fitness landscapes. However, the reliability of the inferred pathway probability distributions has not yet been ascertained. Hence, here I introduce Robust-CBN framework (R-CBN) to ensure robust inference of cancer progression pathways from cross-sectional genomic data. Using synthetic, simulated and real data, I rigorously benchmarked R-CBN as compared to the previous versions of the CBN model including CT-CBN, H-CBN and B-CBN. The results indicate superior robustness of the R-CBN model in various settings, while it is still able to largely retain predictability. Hence, R-CBN as a reliable framework can be used to distill mechanistic insights from genomic data, while it also has the potential to serve as a building block inspiring further methodological innovations in the field.
